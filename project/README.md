This product will allow users, such as students, to check errors in their code for their assignments. The checker will give the users their score after it has been submitted and the system has checked the marking scheme. The feedback the system gives the users, will allow them to be able to make changes or adjustments to their codes before they hand in their assignments, which will also let them learn by themselves. Not only does it save the users’ time going through their own code, it also makes more time for the client’s work on lectures and giving feedback to the users.
The users will not need to ask for the client’s  support every time they run into a problem.
